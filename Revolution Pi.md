## Programming using Go
You can read an analog signal on a RevPi Connect 4 with an analog IO extension module using the Process Data Interface (PDI). You'll need to access specific offsets within the PDI to read the analog input value. I'll create a Go code example based on the premise that you have the appropriate device drivers installed and have set up your device to expose the necessary PDI files.

First, make sure you've installed Go on your RevPi Connect 4. If you haven't, you can usually do so by running `sudo apt-get install golang` from the command line.

Here is a Go program example for reading an analog signal from the RevPi Connect 4:

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/binary"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Replace this path with the actual PDI path for your analog input
	pdiFilePath := "/dev/piControl0"

	// Open the PDI device file for reading
	pdiFile, err := os.OpenFile(pdiFilePath, os.O_RDONLY, 0444)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening PDI file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer pdiFile.Close()

	// Seek to the offset where the analog input value is stored.
	// Replace 'offset' with the actual byte offset for your specific analog input.
	offset := int64(0) // Change this to the actual offset
	_, err = pdiFile.Seek(offset, 0)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error seeking to offset:", err)
		return
	}

	// Read 2 bytes (16 bits) from the PDI device file
	buffer := make([]byte, 2)
	_, err = pdiFile.Read(buffer)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading from PDI file:", err)
		return
	}

	// Convert the 2 bytes to a 16-bit unsigned integer
	analogValue := binary.LittleEndian.Uint16(buffer)

	// Convert the 16-bit unsigned integer to a voltage between 0 and 5V
	voltage := (float64(analogValue) / 65535.0) * 5.0

	// Print the analog input value and the calculated voltage
	fmt.Printf("Analog Value: %d\n", analogValue)
	fmt.Printf("Voltage: %.2f V\n", voltage)
}
```

Please note:

1. Replace the `pdiFilePath` with the correct path for your device.
2. Replace `offset` with the actual byte offset where the analog input value you're interested in is stored.

You may need to adapt this code based on your exact configuration, including the path to your PDI device file and the offset of your specific analog input. Please refer to the documentation for your RevPi Connect 4 and analog IO extension module for these details.

### Cross compile

You can cross-compile Go code on a Mac for a different target system like a RevPi Connect 4, which typically runs on a Linux-based operating system with an ARM processor.

Here are the steps to cross-compile your Go code:

1. **Set the Target OS and Architecture**: Before building, you have to specify the target operating system and processor architecture by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables. For a RevPi Connect 4, you'll likely want to set `GOOS=linux` and `GOARCH=arm`.

2. **Compile the Code**: Once the environment variables are set, you can compile your Go code with the `go build` command.

Here's how you could do it in the terminal:

```bash
# Set the environment variables for cross-compiling
export GOOS=linux
export GOARCH=arm

# Build your Go program
go build -o myProgram main.go
```

This will produce an executable named `myProgram` that should be able to run on your RevPi Connect 4.

3. **Transfer the Executable**: After the executable is built, you'll need to transfer it to your RevPi device. You could use `scp`, `rsync`, or any other method to transfer the file.

4. **Run the Code on RevPi**: Once the executable is on the device, you may need to give it the appropriate permissions using `chmod` and then you can run it.

Please note:

- Depending on the specifics of your RevPi model and its operating system, you may also need to specify additional flags or environment variables.
- Make sure that you have the required libraries and drivers installed on the RevPi Connect 4 for the code to run successfully.

These are general guidelines, and the specific steps might differ depending on your setup and needs.
